/* DOM Manipulation: Independent Practice

To complete this excercise, you must meet the following requirements:

- When the user clicks the "#new-thing-button" button, add whatever is in the input box to the "#my-list" list.
- Only add an item if the input box is not blank.
- Clear the input box when the user clicks the button.

Here are some bonus tasks to push your DOM knowledge!
- Bonus tasks:
  - When a list item is archived, change its background colour to "green"
  - Add a link to each item to delete it completely
  - Instead of deleting it completely, move it to a second list called "Archive"
